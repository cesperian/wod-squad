# WodSquad

This open source project is intended to be a free management app alternative for boxes that are smaller, new startups, currently facing financial challenges, or possibly a combination of these. This motivation is in part founded by the need I have seen firsthand in gyms under the recent strain placed on them by the pandemic. It is my impression that this kind of tool is essential for Crossfit gyms and that there shouldn't be a price-related barrier to entry for those that currently cannot afford a commercial option. The project is currently in the research phase; I am attempting to get opinions of coaches & box owners, insofar as what features they regard as most important, to help make the actual development time as efficient as possible.
